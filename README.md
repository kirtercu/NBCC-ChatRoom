#NBCC-ChatRoom

#Description: 
Based on NBCC database (suppose it is, and i will try to set up somehow like that),  
students can login to chat with others in class, in program, in college.  

#Example:
A  Junior ITPA student can access to chat with all itpa year 1 students, all itpa students, all it students,  
all college students.  

#Adds-on: 
Students can have private chat channel, or little group chat room.  
College can publish news on a News channel that only allow college says some thing/ or publish notification.  
Students can send pictures/emojis.  

#Activities: 
Login  
Channel selection  
Messages  

#Detailed Plan(basic):
Assuming i have NBCC database of students info to login, so students already has group.  
For example, Michael Karl is a ITPA year 2 student in Saint John campus, he has groups - NBCC, NBCCSJ, IT, ITPA, ITPA-yr2.  
So he can select these 5 channels as basic(**I don't have the database, so i will setup a SQLite for groups).  
Michael can message others as what they did on Facebook.
